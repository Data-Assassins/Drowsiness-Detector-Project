- At all sensitive works where it require high level of consciousness where the human error due to lack of attention could cause fatal consequences this raises an important concern for having a way or tool to detect this.

**_Deep Drowsiness Detection_** this app will detect if the person is sleepy, and if he is, this app will do a specific action by first sounding an alarm and also sending an email to the in charge person that can save the situation.

- So, it can be used as a safety technology to prevent human errors that consider critical for example in medical institutions when humman errors of sleepy doctors are fatal.

## Dependencies, Languages and Tools expected to be needed:

- Python Programming Language
- YOLO ( you only look once) deep learning models

## MVP:

- Face Recognition.

- Sleepy Face Detection

- Sending a Report.
